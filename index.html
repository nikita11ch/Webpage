    List of episodes
    The Vampire Diaries is an American supernatural horror romance television series created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_(screenwriter)">Kevin Williamson</a> based on the novels of the same name by author L. J. Smith. It was officially picked up for the 2009–10 season on May 19, 2009.<sup>[1]</sup> It premiered on September 10, 2009, on The CW and received the highest ratings for a series premiere in the network's history at that point, scoring 4.91 million live viewers.<sup>[2][3]</sup>
    
   <p> The series focuses on the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, that is charged with supernatural history. It follows Elena Gilbert portrayed by Nina Dobrev as she begins to get over her parents' death, when two vampires pull her into a world she didn't know before, Stefan and Damon Salvatore, portrayed by Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder, respectively. Kayla Ewell portrayed Vicki Donovan for the first seven episodes until her character was killed off. Matt Davis was later cast as a history teacher in a recurring role to fill the void. He was later upgraded to series regular status.<sup>[4]</sup> The season concluded on May 13, 2010, and consisted of 22 episodes.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
</p>
<p>
  In April 2015, lead actress Nina Dobrev, who played Elena Gilbert, confirmed that she would be leaving the show after its sixth season. Dobrev returned to record a voiceover for the seventh-season finale and returned as a guest star in the series finale.<sup>[3]</sup> In March 2016, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season,<sup>[4]</sup> but in July of that year announced that the eighth season, consisting of 16 episodes, would be the show's last.<sup>[5]</sup> The final season began airing on October 21, 2016, and ended March 10, 2017.

The concepts and characters developed in the series served to launch a media franchise that includes other television series, web series, novels and comic books. The television series The Originals (2013–2018) – which also aired on The CW – was the first major entry in this collection of connected works, followed by a spin-off of The Originals entitled Legacies (2018–2022), which aired on The CW as well.
